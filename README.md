# VOXLENS
💡 VoxLens — Assistive communication device for the Deaf, using ESP8266 and sensors to convert environmental and speech cues into visual alerts.

VoxLens is an assistive device designed to empower individuals who are Deaf or hard of hearing by providing real-time environmental and speech awareness. Built with an ESP8266 microcontroller, VoxLens detects crucial sounds like alarms, doorbells, and speech patterns, converting them into visual or vibrational alerts on a display.

This project aims to bridge communication gaps and enhance accessibility through IoT, embedded systems, and assistive technology innovation.

VoxLens is an assistive device designed to empower individuals who are Deaf or hard of hearing by providing real-time environmental and speech awareness. Built with an ESP8266 microcontroller, VoxLens detects crucial sounds like alarms, doorbells, and speech patterns, converting them into visual or vibrational alerts on a display.

This project aims to bridge communication gaps and enhance accessibility through IoT, embedded systems, and assistive technology innovation.

VoxLens is an assistive device designed to empower individuals who are Deaf or hard of hearing by providing real-time environmental and speech awareness. Built with an ESP8266 microcontroller, VoxLens detects crucial sounds like alarms, doorbells, and speech patterns, converting them into visual or vibrational alerts on a display.

This project aims to bridge communication gaps and enhance accessibility through IoT, embedded systems, and assistive technology innovation.

VoxLens integrates miniature camera modules mounted on the front and both sides of the glasses, enabling real-time visual awareness of the user’s surroundings. The cameras continuously monitor side regions and front view to help detect approaching objects, vehicles, or obstacles, preventing potential accidents and improving mobility safety for Deaf users.

These camera feeds can be processed locally or externally to trigger visual alerts on the OLED display or vibration feedback, ensuring the user is instantly notified of motion or hazards within their field of view.

In future iterations, the camera system will include AI-based object detection and motion tracking (via OpenCV or TinyML) to intelligently recognize vehicles, people, or sudden movements — enhancing spatial awareness and real-time safety.
